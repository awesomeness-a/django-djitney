# Django Djitney

## Introduction
The Codes-ville Official Department of Transportation recently finished building the routes for their new commuter train, the Django Djitney, and need to create 
an easy-to-use site for commuters to be able to see the different train routes across all the stations, as well as update them when there are changes in the routes. 
They’ve supplied the train routes in a database.<br> 
Each jitney line takes different routes through the stations. You can take a look through `models.py` to see how each model relates to each other. 
The basic breakdown is that a “stop” consists of a “line”, a “station”, and a “stop number”.
The project is about creating the functionality to view, edit, update, and delete lines, stops, and stations using Python's framework called Django. 

## Prerequisites
